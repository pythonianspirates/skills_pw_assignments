    "Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept that allows us to focus on the essential features of an object while ignoring its irrelevant details. It is a way to manage complexity and make code more flexible and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved by hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the users. This is typically done by defining abstract classes or interfaces that provide a set of methods that must be implemented by their concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we are designing a banking application. We might have a BankAccount class that represents a customer's bank account. The BankAccount class could have several methods, such as deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance(). However, we don't need to expose the details of how these methods are implemented. Instead, we can create an abstract class or interface called Account that defines these methods without providing their implementation details. The concrete classes such as SavingsAccount or CheckingAccount can then implement these methods according to their specific requirements."
