    "2.Median:\n",
    "- The median is the middle value of a data set when it is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "- If the data set has an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle value.\n",
    "- If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "- The median is not affected by extreme values or outliers, as it only considers the position of values in the data set.\n",
    "- It is often used when the data set contains extreme values or when the distribution is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode:\n",
    "- The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a data set.\n",
    "- It represents the most common value(s) in the data set.\n",
    "- A data set can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).\n",

    "\n",
    "**1.Range :**\n",
    "- The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated by taking the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n",
    "- It provides an estimate of the total spread of the data.\n",
    "- For example, if a dataset contains the values [10, 15, 12, 8, 20], the range would be 20 - 8 = 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Variance :**\n",
    "- Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "- It quantifies the dispersion of the dataset around the mean.\n",
    "- Variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "- For example, if a dataset contains the values [10, 15, 12, 8, 20], and the mean is 13, the variance would be (10-13)² + (15-13)² + (12-13)² + (8-13)² + (20-13)², divided by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Standard Deviation :**\n",
    "- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "- It provides a measure of dispersion that is in the same unit as the original data.\n",
    "- Standard deviation helps to understand the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "- Using the same example as above, after calculating the variance, taking the square root would give the standard deviation.\n",

    "**Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "- Outliers can increase the range of a dataset, as they represent extreme values.\n",
    "- The presence of outliers can greatly influence the variance and standard deviation, as these measures consider the distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
